# Project-Dataset
Codes from dataset hackathon partnered by Nokia and gen ai

# What you need to run this code:
VsCode with streamlit, Python, HTML+CSS, Extensions, (js is not required).

# What is this about?
It's a simple Machine learning plus AI algorithm using gpt-2, it creates a local server in your wifi and you can upload data logs and analytics to see for any potential threats. The format of the log file is specified in the website.
We used pandas, numpy, steamlit, pytorch, tranformers, logging, plotly.


# To run this for yourself
Just copy paste this in vs code with all the extensions.
go to terminal and type "streamlit run (file path)" then click enter. It should automatically open the website.
Better you can just drag the file into terminal.

# This is a simple project and is not to be used in a serious or professional setting.
